***Student Performance Prediction***  

**Project Overview**  

This project builds a regression model to predict student performance based on two key factors:  
i  Hours Studied.  
ii Attendance.  

The goal is to apply Linear Regression using Python to create a predictive model and evaluate its accuracy.  

**Features**  

i   Data preprocessing and cleaning.  
ii  Building a Linear Regression model.  
iii Model training and testing.  
iv  Performance evaluation using accuracy metrics.  

**Technologies Used**  

i   Python.  
ii  Pandas – Data manipulation.  
iii Numpy – Numerical operations.  
iv  Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data Visualization.  
v   Scikit-learn – Machine learning (Linear Regression, metrics). 

**Workflow**  

i   Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, encoding, and scaling if needed.  
ii  Model Building – Using LinearRegression from sklearn.  
iii Model Training & Testing – Splitting data into train/test sets.  
iv  Evaluation – Checking model accuracy and error metrics (MSE, R²).  

**Expected Outcome**  

i  Predict a student’s performance score based on study hours and attendance.  
ii Gain insights into how each factor influences performance.
