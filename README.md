***Student Performance Prediction***  

**Project Overview**  

This project builds a regression model to predict student performance based on two key factors:  
i  Hours Studied  
ii Attendance  

The goal is to apply Linear Regression using Python to create a predictive model and evaluate its accuracy.  

**Features**  

i   Data preprocessing and cleaning  
ii  Building a Linear Regression model  
iii Model training and testing  
iv  Performance evaluation using accuracy metrics  

**Technologies Used**  

Python  
Pandas – Data manipulation  
Numpy – Numerical operations  
Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization  
Scikit-learn – Machine learning (Linear Regression, metrics)  

**Workflow**  

Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, encoding, and scaling if needed  
Model Building – Using LinearRegression from sklearn  
Model Training & Testing – Splitting data into train/test sets  
Evaluation – Checking model accuracy and error metrics (MSE, R²)  

**Expected Outcome**  

Predict a student’s performance score based on study hours and attendance  
Gain insights into how each factor influences performance
